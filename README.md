## Vision!

The Tokenized Educational Competitions project aims to integrate blockchain technology into educational competitions by using a custom ERC-20 token, **EduToken**, as rewards for competition winners. This system encourages participation and engagement in educational activities, ensuring transparency and security through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Flowchart

1. **Deploy EduToken Contract:**
   - Initialize the token with a supply.
   - Contract Address: `0x873710129e1f9534309ebACE9Dae1e2C25f572B3`

2. **Deploy TokenizedCompetition Contract:**
   - Pass the EduToken contract address and competition duration.
   - Contract Address: `0x873710129e1f9534309ebACE9Dae1e2C25f572B3`

3. **Competition Lifecycle:**
   - **Register Participants:** Owner registers participants before the competition end time.
   - **Update Scores:** Owner updates participants' scores during the competition.
   - **End Competition:** Owner finalizes the competition, determines the winner.
   - **Award Tokens:** Owner awards tokens to the winner.

4. **Post-Competition:**
   - **View Participants:** Check the list of participants.
   - **View Scores:** Retrieve individual scores.
   - **Competition Details:** Get the winner, winning score, and end time.

## Contract Addresses

- **EduToken Contract Address:** `0x873710129e1f9534309ebACE9Dae1e2C25f572B3`

## Future Scope

1. **Token Ownership Control:** Implement ownership checks for `mint` and `burn` functions to restrict access.
2. **Enhanced User Interface:** Develop a web-based or mobile interface for managing competitions and interacting with the smart contracts.
3. **Advanced Scoring Mechanisms:** Introduce more complex scoring algorithms and multi-tier competitions.
4. **Integration with Educational Platforms:** Collaborate with educational institutions to integrate blockchain-based competitions into existing platforms.
